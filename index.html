        <h1>Lose Yourself Installation</h1>
        <p>This is a video of my installation from the summer session</p>
        <p>The installation renders geometric shapes based on Islamic design patterns which are altered based upon the music as well as brain activity collected via an EEG head monitor.</p>
            
        <p>By default, without the headband, the geometric shapes have a blue background and are rendered without much variance. When the headband is worn, based on the viewers brain activity and facial expressions, the background color changes to red and the shapes are much more varied and noisy.</p>
    
        <p>The experience is for the viewer to try and lose themselves in the patterns and colors by trying to calm their mind</p>
